# script-merge-csv
Windows .bat script to merge CSV files in a directory. This script will take the header from the first file, and append the data from all other files. It expects each file to be in the same format. 

To configure the script, edit the directory locations and file names as needed. 

The script can be scheduled to run at regular intervals on a Windows Server with Windows Task Scheduler by following the instructions in [this guide] (https://www.thewindowsclub.com/how-to-schedule-batch-file-run-automatically-windows-7).
